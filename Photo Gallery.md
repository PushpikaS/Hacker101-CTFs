## Flag0 
- Consider how you might build this system yourself. What would the query for fetch look like?
- Take a few minutes to consider the state of the union
- This application runs on the uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker image

## Flag1 
- I never trust a kitten I can't see
- Or a query whose results I can't see, for that matter

## Flag2 
- That method of finding the size of an album seems suspicious
- Stacked queries rarely work. But when they do, make absolutely sure that you're committed
- Be aware of your environment
